Elizabeth
=========

Ellie uses the recently released [API](https://dev.moves-app.com/) of [Moves](http://www.moves-app.com/) to export your carefully tracked movement data.

This is just a first quick shot at playing with the API, feel free to improve the export plugins, add others, fork and do stuff! Any help will be greatly appreciated.

(And it's my first public NodeJS project, so please be nice.)
